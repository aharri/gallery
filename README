The purpose of this yet another PHP photo gallery
is to be small but usable. Just drop the folder inside
your webroot and configure data and tmp directories.
The tmp directory needs to be writable by the web
user. Gallery will automatically handle thumbnails
once you put some images inside your data directory.

Requirements:
- PHP-gd

TODO:
- A proper README ( :-P )
- Remove duplicate <hr> tags in some cases
